## learning some new things in yul!!

it's not assembly and it seeks to be close to bytecode

only understands bytes32, 256 bits words, so booleans are either 1 (true) or 0 (false)

does not access memory 

have learned:

- basic operations
- storage slots
- storage offsets and bitshifting
- array and mapping

it's a bit scary but really interesting
